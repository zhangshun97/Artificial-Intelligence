# Artificial Intelligence

This is a [course](http://www.sdspeople.fudan.edu.cn/zywei/DATA130008/index.html) for junior students in the School of Data Science, Fudan University. It's mainly adapted from course [CS188](http://ai.berkeley.edu/home.html) at Berkeley. Check out the CS188 website for more materials.

## 1. Overview

The course mainly covers the following SIX topics.

- Classical Search Algorithms (BFS, DFS, UCS, A*, Adversarial Search)
- Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP)
- Bayes' Net and Inference
- Hidden Markov Model (HMM)
- Markov Decision Problems (MDPs)
- Reinforcement Learning (active/negative learning, Q-learning)

## 2. Course Labs

There are four Labs during the semester on the following four topics respectively.

- [Uniform Cost Search](https://github.com/zhangshun97/Artificial-Intelligence/tree/master/Labs/Lab_1_search)
- [$\alpha$-$\beta$ pruning in Minimax Search](https://github.com/zhangshun97/Artificial-Intelligence/tree/master/Labs/Lab_2_pruning)
- [MDPs (value/policy iteration)](https://github.com/zhangshun97/Artificial-Intelligence/tree/master/Labs/Lab_3_MDP)
- [Exact inference in Bayes' Net](https://github.com/zhangshun97/Artificial-Intelligence/tree/master/Labs/Lab_4_BayesNet)

## 3. Course Projects

There are also four mini-projects during the semester on the following four topics respectively.

- [Search in Pacman](https://github.com/zhangshun97/Artificial-Intelligence/tree/master/Projects/Project_1_search)
- [CSP in n-queens](https://github.com/zhangshun97/Artificial-Intelligence/tree/master/Projects/Project_2_nqueens)

- [MDPs and Q-learning in blackjack](https://github.com/zhangshun97/Artificial-Intelligence/tree/master/Projects/Project_3_blackjack)
- [HMM and inference](https://github.com/zhangshun97/Artificial-Intelligence/tree/master/Projects/Project_4_car)
